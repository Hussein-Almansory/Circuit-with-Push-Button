## What is push-button?

A push-button (also spelled pushbutton) or simply button is a simple switch mechanism to control some aspect of a machine or a process. Buttons are typically made out of hard material, usually plastic or metal.

## Features of push-button :
* Prevent flux rise by the insert-molded terminal
* Snap-in mount terminal
* Dielectric Withstanding Voltage 250V AC for 1 minute


## Where to use push button?

Push Buttons are normally-open
tactile switches. Push buttons allow us to 
power the circuit or make any particular
connection only when we press the button. Simply,
it makes the circuit connected when pressed and breaks
when released.

## Tasks

I created a simple circuit with two push buttons with a dc motor 
the first push button will move the dc-motor anti-clockwise while 
the other one will move the dc-motor with clockwise.
